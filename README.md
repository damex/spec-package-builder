# spec package builder

## Description

This repository contains spec files for building RPM packages.

It includes a `Makefile` that builds packages natively on `Red Hat Linux` or its derivatives.

The `Makefile` accepts `SPEC_FILE` as a mandatory input, allowing you to specify the path to the spec file included in the `SPECS` directory.
